	"changeNote": "Tidied up some details of the stick collection, descriptions, removing DLC auto-learning, etc  Removing some test assets bloating the mod.  Fixing the blueprint on the \"pointy stick\", and all the tags on all the things (some were fine, but a lot were missing)\nAKA, tidy up for pre-3.0, seeing as the devkit is about to be 3.0'ed",
