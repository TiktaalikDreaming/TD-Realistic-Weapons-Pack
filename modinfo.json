	"description": "Intended to add some vaguely more realistic weapons from history instead of the very fantasy cliche things in the game.  \n\nA list of Items is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cTkd5ywF-1B9_VwyOHvri-QBNvMNvPp4/view?usp=sharing\n\nMod discord here https://discord.gg/XEUZxZRVF9",
	"changeNote": "Remeshed Battlement using existing FunCom meshes and textures mixed with mine. \nAdded a test focus for Set, no recipe, admin spawn only so far\nSwitched out most of my custom materials to instances of Funcom materials to have things like blood applied.\nRemoved a few unused assets that were auto-imported but not used.",
