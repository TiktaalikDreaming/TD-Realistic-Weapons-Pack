	"description": "Intended to add some vaguely more realistic weapons from history instead of the very fantasy cliche things in the game.  \n\nA list of Items is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZiykgA4npQV8E5ynbByaZqwU-8l45EgR/view?usp=sharing\n\nMod discord here https://discord.gg/6xJZUPUm",
	"changeNote": "Added a place holder test Buckler for Ophir.  Only the mesh and textures will change, that item code will stay a buckler (small centre grip shield).  Also, when adding the shield, the metal surfaces made it clear there are significant difference in rendering roughness values between substance and unreal.  All materials in this mod now have a roughness modifier to take the original 0.0->1.0 value and shift it to 0.3->1.0   AKA everything got less shiney, and the maximum glossiness is dropped to 70% of what it was..",
