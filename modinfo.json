	"changeNote": "Complete revision of the Arrow Slit.  I Conan-ified it.  The original was more similar to more historical arrow slits int hat it was inset int a thick wall.  Castle walls are closer to Conan foundation thickness than wall thickness.  But, in game, it never really functioned well.  It had troubles placing ceilings over it, and I meant to try out using the existing materials.  So the new one is basically the T3 wall with an arrow slit chopped out.",
