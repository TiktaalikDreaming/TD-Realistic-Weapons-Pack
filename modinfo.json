	"description": "Intended to add some vaguely more realistic weapons from history instead of the very fantasy cliche things in the game.  \n\nA list of Items is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cTkd5ywF-1B9_VwyOHvri-QBNvMNvPp4/view?usp=sharing\n\nMod discord here https://discord.gg/XEUZxZRVF9",
	"changeNote": "Rebalanced all weapon damage to better fit with vanilla conan.\nChanged crafting ot sticks and clubs to hand crafted.  Some still require shaped wood though.\nFixed some issues with repairs on taiaha and vanir axe having things in the wrong columns, and probably being unrepairable.\nChanged longswords to katana move set.\n",
