	"description": "Intended to add some vaguely more realistic weapons from history instead of the very fantasy cliche things in the game.  \n\nA list of Items is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cTkd5ywF-1B9_VwyOHvri-QBNvMNvPp4/view?usp=sharing\n\nMod discord here https://discord.gg/XEUZxZRVF9\n\nThe scabbards (and now ribbons) are intended for use with ToT! Custom or similar mods.  They won't on their own be useful, you would need a mod that allows items marked as weapons to show sheathed as accessories, and for that system to allow overlapping.  See https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886779102\n\nLongsword Animations are (modified by me for the Conan skeleton) (C) Jakub Kisiel aka Kubold",
